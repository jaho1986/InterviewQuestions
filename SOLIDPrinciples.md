## SOLID design principles
Are the design principles that enable us to manage most of the software design problems. The termn SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, fexible and maintainable.

- **S**: Single responsablility principle.
- **O**: Open closed principle.
- **L**: Liskov substitution principle.
- **I**: Interface segregation principle.
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle.

#### Single responsablility principle
Every module or class should have responsability over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsability should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

#### Open closed principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

#### Liskov substitution principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

#### Interface segregation principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. We should not enforce clients to implement interfaces that they don't use. Instead of creating a big interface we can break down it to smaller interfaces.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle:
This pattern says that abstractions should not depend on the details, whereas the details should depend on abstractions.
High-level modules should not depend on low level modules.
It's used to create loosely coupled software modules. Modules should depend on abstraction by the use of interfaces instead of creating new objects inside a class.

#### Features of SOLID principles:
- Achieve reduction in complexity of code.
- Increases readability, extensibility and maintenance.
- Reduce error and implement reusability.
- Achieve better testability.
- Reduce tight coupling.
 
### Solution to develop a successful application
- Architecture: Choosing an architecture is the first step in designing application based on the requirements (MVC, WebAPI, etc).
- Design principles.
- Design patterns.
