Object oriented programming.
Is ma methodology or paradigm to design a program using Classes and Objects

Object 
Is a real world entity that has teir own properties an behaviours.

Class
Blueprint from wich objects properties a behaviours are decided.

Polymorphism:
Concept in wich a single action can be done in different ways.

Static Polymorphism:
Is the one that is resolved in compile time. Method overloading is an example of compile time polymorphism.

Dynamic Polymorphism:
Dynamic porlymorphism is a process in wich a call to an overridden methos is resolved at runtime. That's why it is called runtime polymorphism.

Advantages:
 - Support method overriding
 - Common method specification.

Example:
Cass A has a method move()
Cass B has a method move()
You create instances of the to classes and you call the method move of each class.

Characteristics of Polymorphism:
 - Operator overloading. (Operator + sum, or concatenate).
 - Polimorphic paarameters. (When you have local variables with the same name as the instance variables).
 
Super Keyword:
Super is a keyword. It is used inside a sub-class mehotd definition to call a  method in the superclass.
