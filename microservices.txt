Monolithic Applications:
Monolithic Achitecture is like a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged.

Monolithic Architecture - Challenges:
 - Large & Complex Applications
 - Slow Development
 - Blocks Continous Development
 - Unscalable
 - Unreliable (Because of ghe tightly coupled components if one of then goes down, the entire system will fail to run).
 - Inflexible (difficult to include new framewors or technologies).

Microservice Architecture:
Is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, modelled arround a Bisness Domain. In Microservice Architecture, each service is self-contained and implements a single business Capability.

Features of Microservices:
 - Each microservice is idenpendent. 
 - Small focused
 - Loosely coupled.
 - Language Neutral.
 - Bounded Context. (Any microservice dowsn't need to know the implementation of another microservice).
 
Advantages of Microservices:
 - Independent Development.
 - Fault Isolation.
 - Mixed Technology Stack.
 - Granular Scaling.

Microservices Architecture:
Management component:
Is responsable for placing services or nodes, identifying falures, rebalancing services across nodes.

Service Discovery:
Mantain a list of services and wich node are located on.

API Gateway:
Is the entry point for clients.
