# AWS Services
At AWS, we look at compute in three areas

## Compute services
Provides virtual server hosting, container management, and serverless computing.

The serverless compute options translate to more time for you to focus on your core applications. You don't have to worry about managing and operating the underlying infrastructure.

## AWS storage and database services
Allows for the storage, archiving, and retrieval of information. With AWS, you get a broad selection of purpose-built storage and database solutions for all your application needs.
